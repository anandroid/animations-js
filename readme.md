# Three.js Bouncing Ball

This project shows a simple bouncing ball animation built with [Three.js](https://threejs.org/).

## Running the Demo

Install dependencies (none required) and start the server:

```bash
npm start
```

Then open <http://localhost:3000> in your browser. The Three.js library is loaded from a CDN, so an internet connection is required the first time `index.html` is opened.

## Development

If you change the code, simply refresh the browser window to see the updates. You can also run:

```bash
npm test
```

This runs a basic test to ensure the server serves `index.html` correctly.
