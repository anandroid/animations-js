# Three.js Bouncing Ball

This project shows a simple bouncing ball animation built with [Three.js](https://threejs.org/). No additional build tools are required. To view the animation, open `index.html` in any modern web browser.

## Development

If you change the code, simply refresh the browser window to see the updates. The Three.js library is loaded from a CDN, so an internet connection is required the first time `index.html` is opened.
